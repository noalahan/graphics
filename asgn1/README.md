# Assignment 1

### Objectives: 
To create a simple paint program that draws on the screen when you drag with your mouse.  

Basic features:
- A canvas where the user can click to draw simple geometric shapes.
- When the user clicks on the canvas, a shape (square, triangle or circle) is drawn on the clicked position.
- When the user clicks and drags the mouse on the canvas, shapes are drawn along the dragged direction.
- Buttons to choose between points, circle and triangle brushes.
- A slider to determine the number of segments used to create a circle.
- A button to clear the canvas.
- A slider to set the brush/shape size.
- Three sliders to control the shades of red, green and blue of the brush/shape color

Beyond the basics:

- You will design a drawing on paper first, and draw it using triangles. Remember that you can put the vertices of the triangle wherever you want, and you have a function to draw a triangle from the basic assignment. It may be useful to draw axes for your sketch to determine where your triangles will be drawn on the canvas. Don't just use the basic painting triangle shape, move those vertices around to where you need them.
- Do something awesome. This is very underdefined on purpose. Creativity is required.
