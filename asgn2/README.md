# Assignment 2 - Blocky Animal

### Objectives
To transform (translation, rotation, scaling, etc) simple 2D geometric shapes and 3D objects using matrices. 

### Requirements
The basic assignment: Create a simple 3D animal. You will create this out of simple geometric objects, like cubes, spheres, and cylinders.  The animal must have at least 8 parts, e.g. body, upper legs (x4), lower legs(x4), head OR whatever. The sample above has 20+ parts. There needs to be at least one chain of parts that extends at least two elements away from the body. For example, there should be a bend at the knee so the leg has two parts. At least one part should animate. There should be a way (slider or mouse) to rotate the object and see the animal from all sides.  There should be slider control of at least two joints in a chain. 

Hard stuff for max points is described in bullet 11 below: Color, full animation, third level joint, non-cube primitive, second animation, mouse rotation, performance.
